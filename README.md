# Overview

This project is an effort to build a better understanding of C++.

A popular project for C++ is building a login manager.  This program includes features that allow users to create new user names and passwords and login with existing usernames
and passwords.  There are also various features like encryption, decryption, and error checks.

This program was a good exercise of using C++ for a practical application.  I wanted to get an idea of what that would look like using C++.

# Development Environment

I used the Atom text editor with extra packages installed to compile and run C++.  The Command Prompt terminal is used as an interface to use the program.

C++ is a statically typed object-oriented programming language.  For this project I used the <iostream>(for input and output), <fstream>(for working with files), and
<sstream>(for converting variables to different types).
